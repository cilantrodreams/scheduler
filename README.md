# Interview Scheduler

Interview Scheduler is a single page web application that allows students to book, edit and cancel interviews with mentors. It is built using the React view library with the focus of creating a modern client application interface. Data is persisted by an API server using a PostgreSQL database. Storybook is used to develop React components and Jest is used throughout the development of the project for testing.

This application was developed as a project assignment for Lighthouse Labs Web Development Bootcamp.
